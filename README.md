# TypeScript basics

Basic concepts of TypeScript features covered in [classes.ts](https://github.com/cyb3rD/TS-Basics/blob/master/classes.ts)
All other files just sample drafts.

As of my IDE I'm using **Visual Studio Code** with build task.

###...before compile you might need to do
```
npm install -g typescript
```
